# Exemple

This folder demonstrates the usage of the `native-protection-transformer` library, a TypeScript transformer that isolates native document APIs using an iframe.

## How to Run

1. Build the project by running:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check the `rollup.config.js` file to see how the transformer is integrated.

3. Look at the output in the `dist` folder.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Rollup installed to test the example.
- Modify the `src/test.ts` file to experiment with the transformer.
